# JNote

## About

JNote is an elegant notepad application designed for command line productivity.
It provides an effective interface to filter and select notes. The enabled mode
will dictate what happens to a note when it is selected. The default mode is 
"edit", which opens notes in the $EDITOR of your choice (vi by default). 
Other modes include "delete", "echo", and "copy". JNote also supports note 
versioning and synchronization via git.
